	abstract = {This paper provides an analysis on the costs of generating electricity from nuclear and fossil sources (coal and natural gas) based on the most recent technical data available in literature. The aim is to discuss the competitiveness of nuclear power in a liberalized market context by considering the impact on the generating costs of the main factors affecting the viability of the nuclear option. Particular attention will be devoted to study the variability of the generating costs regarding the level of risk perceived by investors through a sensitivity analysis of the generating costs with respect to the cost of capital and the debt fraction of initial investment. The impact of environment policies is also considered by including a “tax” on carbon emissions. The analysis reveals that nuclear power could have ample potentiality also in a competitive market, particularly if the level of risk perceived by the investors keeps standing low. For low values of the cost of capital, nuclear power seems to be the most viable solution. Uncertainty about environmental policies and unpredictability of carbon emissions costs might offer further margins of competitiveness.},

	abstract = {Although economics will certainly not be the only criterion for deploying fast reactors, it will be an important one. In this paper we will present a method for analysing their competitiveness in comparison with thermal neutron reactors. We will use the levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) method to compare the production costs of each technology.
For forecasting the uranium cost, which is an important question for competitiveness, we have proposed a model based on supply curve. This model approximates the uranium costs over the assumed 60-year operating lifetime of new reactors, according to their commissioning date.
Concerning the fuel cycle costs, we have taken into account the fact that they will differ according to whether or not the reactor is in a country which has already chosen to treat and recycle spent fuel (back-end of the cycle).
A uranium equivalent value is then calculated for which the kWh costs of each reactor technology would be the same. This enables us to determine the period when FRs will become competitive according to various parameters.
The uranium supply curve appears to be the most influential parameter for any given nuclear demand, followed by the discount rate, prior choices regarding the back-end of the cycle, and the additional investment cost of FRs in comparison with PWRs.},

	abstract = {The existing literature on the construction costs of nuclear power reactors has focused almost exclusively on trends in construction costs in only two countries, the United States and France, and during two decades, the 1970s and 1980s. These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost (OCC) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the US, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},
