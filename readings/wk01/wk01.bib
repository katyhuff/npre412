	abstract = {It is well known that electrical power generation is the key factor for advances in industry, agriculture, technology, and the standard of living. Also, strong power industry with diverse energy sources is very important for a country's independence. In general, electrical energy can be generated from: (1) nonrenewable energy sources such as coal, natural gas, oil, and nuclear; and (2) renewable energy sources such as hydro, biomass, wind, geothermal, solar, and marine power. Today, the main sources for electrical energy generation are: (1) thermal power—primarily using coal and secondarily using natural gas; (2) “large” hydroelectric power plants; and (3) nuclear power. The balance of the energy sources is from using oil, biomass, wind, geothermal and solar, and has visible impact just in a few countries. This chapter presents the current status of electricity generation in the world, various sources of industrial electricity generation, role of nuclear power with a comparison of nuclear energy systems to other energy systems.},

The recommendations in the report call for the establishment of an advanced nuclear energy cost and performance database that will be developed, housed, and overseen by a Department of Energy office or national laboratory with expertise in advanced nuclear energy technologies. Moreover, the recommendations call for energy system modelers to update their default system model assumptions to reflect ranges based on advanced nuclear reactor developer survey results and the cost and performance parameters published in recent studies.},
