The book covers all aspects of the nuclear fuel cycle-from cradle to grave. Topics include the available nuclear fuel resources (uranium and thorium), extraction of the metals from the ore, fabrication of nuclear fuel, use of the fuel for power generation, and management and disposal of used fuel and radioactive wastes. Other topics discussed are basic reactor physics, in-core and out-of-core fuel management, possible fuel cycles, nuclear power economics, and nuclear safeguards. The various methods of generating electricity are also described and compared, concentrating on their environmental effects.},

	abstract = {This report summarizes the efforts of NIA, and more than 100 other participants, to establish a collective understanding of the gaps that exist between the real and anticipated costs and capabilities of advanced nuclear energy technologies and the characterization of those costs and capabilities in prominent energy system modeling efforts; and to outline collectively a set of actions that could be taken by the energy modeling community and the federal government to help close those gaps. The recommendations in the report call for the establishment of an advanced nuclear energy cost and performance database that will be developed, housed, and overseen by a Department of Energy office or national laboratory with expertise in advanced nuclear energy technologies. Moreover, the recommendations call for energy system modelers to update their default system model assumptions to reflect ranges based on advanced nuclear reactor developer survey results and the cost and performance parameters published in recent studies.},

	abstract = {The Path to a New Era for Nuclear Energy is a new report by the International Energy Agency that looks at the opportunities for nuclear energy to address energy security and climate concerns – and at critical elements needed to pursue these opportunities, including policies, innovation and financing. Nuclear energy is a well-established technology that has provided electricity and heat to consumers for well over 50 years but has faced a number of challenges in recent years. However, nuclear energy is making a strong comeback, with rising investment, new technology advances and supportive policies in over 40 countries. Electricity demand is projected to grow strongly over the next decades, including from data centres, further underpinning the importance of having sufficient new sources of stable low-emissions electricity.},
