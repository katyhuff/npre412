    "# Conversion\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversion is the process by which yellowcake (primarily $U_3O_8$) becomes uranium hexafluoride ($UF_6$). This step is necessary because most enrichment processes require that the material reach a gaseous phase at relatively low temperatures. \n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Differentiate yellowcake from uranium hexafluoride according to chemical and physical differences.\n",
    "- Understand the physical reason that conversion is necessary.\n",
    "- Recognize the special features of Uranium hexafluoride ($UF_6$) that make it a suitable chemical form. \n",
    "- Model the energy balances and economics of uranium conversion.\n"
