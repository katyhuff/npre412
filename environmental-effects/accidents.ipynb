    "> The approximately 2 million people around TMI-2 during the accident are estimated to have received an average radiation dose of only about 1 millirem above the usual background dose. To put this into context, exposure from a chest X-ray is about 6 millirem and the area's natural radioactive background dose is about 100-125 millirem per year for the area. The accident's maximum dose to a person at the site boundary would have been less than 100 millirem above background. -- [http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html](http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/fact-sheets/3mile-isle.html)"
