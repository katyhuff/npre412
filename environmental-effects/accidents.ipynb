The milling of uranium ore produced an acidic slurry of ground waste rock and fluid tailings that was pumped to the tailings disposal area. The breach released more than 1,100 short tons, 1000 t, of solid radioactive mill waste and 94 million US gallons 360,000 m3 of acidic, radioactive tailings solution into the Puerco River through Pipeline Arroyo. An estimated 1.36 short tons, 1.23 t, of uranium and 46 curies of alpha contaminants traveled 80 miles, 130 km, downstream to Navajo County, Arizona, and onto the Navajo Nation.  In addition to being radioactive and acidic, the spill contained toxic metals and sulfates. The spill contaminated groundwater and rendered the Puerco unusable to local residents, mostly Navajo peoples who used the river's water for drinking, irrigation, and livestock. They were not warned for days of the toxic dangers from the spill. The Governor of New Mexico Bruce King refused the Navajo Nation's request that the site be declared a federal disaster area, limiting aid to affected residents. The nuclear contamination event received less media coverage than that of Three Mile Island, likely because it occurred in a lightly populated, rural area.)\n",
