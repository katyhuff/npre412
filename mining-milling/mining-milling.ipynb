    "**Mining:** Nuclear fuel starts as natural uranium or thorium deposits in the earth. This material can be mined from the ground or even extracted from the sea. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Milling:** and other chemical and physical processes then follow in order to produce a uniform, concentrated material. In the case of Uranium, the product is called 'yellowcake'.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Describe the extent, geography, and characteristics of uranium and thorium resources.\n",
    "- Understand various methods of prospecting.\n",
    "- Differentiate various methods for uranium extraction.\n",
    "- Model the economic relationship between uranium resources and extraction price.\n",
    "- Apply decay energy calculations to the Radon decay chain.\n",
    "- Evaluate the radiation danger associated with uranium mining. \n",
    "- Calculate radition exposure for mine workers.\n",
    "- Understand the process in milling operations.\n",

    "- There is a great deal of both uranium and thorium available, depending on the price.\n",
    "- Certain nations have a great deal more resources than other nations (see: Canada, Khazakstan, Australia)\n",
    "- Prospecting uses biology, geology, radiology, and electromagnetism to identify uranium and thorium resources\n",
    "- Biological prospecting relies on indicator plants which seek out areas rich in indicative minerals\n",
    "- Aerial prospecting relies on gamma spectrometers and magnetometers\n",
    "- Surface prostpecting relies on handheld detectors\n",
    "- Well logging maps the subsurface vertically with detection in wells\n",
    "- Uranium can be extracted from the ground with open pit mines, underground mines, in situ leaching, and even seawater extraction. \n",
    "- Prospecting for mineral resources and the ability to extract those resources respond to market price.\n",
    "- The Radon decay chain is responsible for radiation dangers to mine workers and is measured in Working Level or Working Level Months.\n",
    "- The energy of radon daughter alphas can be calculated for each decay.\n",
    "- Radiation effects are expressed in many units and the weighting factors related to biological impacts are approximate and controversial.\n",
    "- Milling requires separation of the uranium via ion exchange with carbonates or acids. \n",
    "- The milling process associated with in situ leaching conducts chemistry underground and accordingly avoids tailings piles.\n",
    "- Concentrate, yellow, $U_3O_8$ is the results of milling operations and is known as 'yellowcake'."
