Sometimes, I will call them by their old name, \"IPython notebooks,\" but I'm talking about \"Jupyter notebooks\". Interleaved with the course notes, we will often write small functions in the Python programming language to represent the equations we are talking about. This will allow you to interact with the math, changing variables, modifying the models, and exploring the parameter space. \n",

Programming is really hard without the internet. \n",

These are short and are not meant to be difficult. They exist to quickly solidify an idea before we move on to the next one. I will often randomly call on students (with a random number generator populated with the enrollment list) to give solutions to the exercises, so **a failure to show up and participate will be noticed.** \n",

    "These notebooks are stored \"in the cloud,\" which is to say that they are stored on someone else's computers. Those computers are servers at GitHub, a sometimes silly but also very important company in the beautiful city of San Francisco. GitHub stores \"git repositories\" which are collections of files that are \"version controlled\" by the the program \"git.\" This is a lot to keep track of, and I won't require that you learn git to participate in this class. However, I strongly recommend using git and GitHub and to keep track of your research code. So, I will incentivize you to learn and use these tools by giving bonus points here and there for use of git and GitHub. For example, I will be giving 1 bonus point per homework for those of you who submit your homework to me using git. \n",
